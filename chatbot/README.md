## Simple AI Chatbot for our AI Expert Team

Useful documentation, that I used for this project: - [Get started with Claude 3.7 Sonnet](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/guides/sonnet-3-7)


## Getting Started

First, create a .env.local file and add your personal anthropic-api-key
If you don't have one already, visit: console.anthropic.com

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
